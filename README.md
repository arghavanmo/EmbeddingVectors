This is a replication package for the article 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05132"><strong>Dev2vec: Representing Domain Expertise of Developers in an Embedding Spac</strong></a>
    
The paper aims to encode the expertise of developers, learned from different source of information, into embedding vectors.<br />
These vectors are learned based on dov2vec model that is trained on three different sources of information: repository meta data, issue resolving history and API calls.<br />
We name these models: dev2vec:repos, dev2vec:Issues and dev2vec:APIs <br />

You can download the two models dev2vec:repos and dev2vec:Issues from <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7580313"><strong>here</strong></a>
